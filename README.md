# umpires

Plan: Grade each umpires based on rulebook strikezone.  Split errors into components: 
* error due to the difference between the umpires strikezone and rule book strikezone.
* error due to persisent biases in strikezone: home/away and by count
* inconsistency in umpire strike zone.

Additional questions:
Due more inconsistent umpires (worse umpires?) also have more persistent biases?  (This might help us answer why the count bias exists.)
